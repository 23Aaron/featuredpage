It also allows repositories to handle payments seamlessly and natively on iOS 11 or higher, with payments secured by Touch/Face ID.\n\nSileo uses the latest versions of both DPKG and APT to ensure that users get the best possible experience with the latest optimizations and stability fixes applied for both. Both DPKG and APT have minimal patches to ensure they may continue to be updated, while still being compatible with most existing iOS repositories.",

Great effort has been taken to ensure that the entire process from app launch to package installation has been streamlined, with no processes being duplicated where possible, to ensure a better, faster, and more stable overall experience.\n\n#### Free\n\nSileo is available, free of charge, for all iOS 11 & 12 devices running the Electra & Chimera jailbreak.",
